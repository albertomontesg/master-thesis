\chapter{Discussion}
The discussion section gives an interpretation of what you have done \cite{day2006wap}:

\begin{itemize}
 \item \textit{What do your results mean?} Here you discuss, but you do not recapitulate results. Describe principles, relationships and generalizations shown. Also, mention inconsistencies or exceptions you found.
 \item \textit{How do your results relate to other's work?} Show how your work agrees or disagrees with other's work. Here you can rely on the information you presented in the ``related work'' section.
 \item \textit{What are implications and applications of your work?} State how your methods may be applied and what implications might be. 
\end{itemize}

\noindent Make sure that introduction/related work and the discussion section act as a pair, i.e. ``be sure the discussion section answers what the introduction section asked'' \cite{day2006wap}.
