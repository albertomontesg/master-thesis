\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{cha:conclusionsfuturework}

We present a single model that is capable of segmenting instances given a point in the first frame.

The tracking performance is poor and present some flaws with occlusions and small objects.

The segmentation through embedding similarity is promising. The learned embedding seem to represent very well object and differ them between instances.

New experiments that can be done from here as future work.

% The tracking of points we were able to obtain a good coverage of the points, but the localization performance was not so good. Track a point (or pixel) is not as good as tracking a whole instance.

% Then talk about the problems with the metric learning and the learned embedding.
% List the conclusions of your work and give evidence for these. Often, the discussion and the conclusion sections are fused.
