\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{cha:conclusionsfuturework}

The tracking of points we were able to obtain a good coverage of the points, but the localization performance was not so good. Track a point (or pixel) is not as good as tracking a whole instance.

Then talk about the problems with the metric learning and the learned embedding.
List the conclusions of your work and give evidence for these. Often, the discussion and the conclusion sections are fused.
