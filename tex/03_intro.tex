During the last year Computer Vision... % blabla

This thesis focuses on the problem of video object segmentation. ...

In previous works there has been mainly two different approaches to tackle this problem, semi-supervised and unsupervised.
% Talk about them

% We present a new way to tackle this problem in a waekly semi-supervised manner.

% Our method propose to perform two tasks and fuse them to obtain a final prediction: point tracking and instance segmentation from point.
% Methods used.

% To evaluate our methods we have use the DAVIS dataset and PASCAL dataset as suport to train a model to be able to embed images with different instances of the same class.

% The document is structured as folows



% Aditional contributions I have made during my thesis
% In adition to the research, I have contributed in side projects and research related with segmentation.
% To help my research, and the others in the Segmentation Group at CVL, I developed a web interface which allowes to annotate and visualize results.
% Also I have contributed on preparing the a new track on the segmentation field which consists on interactive segmentation. In relation with this, I helped collecting data with the annotation tool, and also develop a framework to evaluate interactive segmentation using human and automatic generated scribbles.
