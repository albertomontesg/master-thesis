In the first place, I would like to thank Dr. Jordi Pont-Tuset for allowing me to do my master thesis with the segmentation group at the Computer Vision Lab. 
In extension, I would like to thank Kevis Maninis and Sergi Caelles for their advisory work. 
I am very gratefully to them all for their patiente and guidance during this Master Thesis. 
They also have teached me how to do research in the Computer Vision field.

From ETH Z\"urich, I would like to thank Prof. Luc Van Gool for giving me the opportunity to perform research in the Computer Vision Lab.
In addition I would like to thank all the professors I had from the courses taken, from which I have learned a lot.

From UPC Barcelona, I would like to mention Prof. Xavi Gir\'o-i-Nieto, Amaia Salvador and Santiago Pascual from the Image Processing Group. 
With them, when I was performing my Bachelor Thesis, I was introduced to Computer Vision and Image Processing and they supported me to pursuing my studies in this field.

I would also like to thank my girlfriend Judith Bergad\`a for all her support given to me during the development of my studies and this thesis, and pushing me forward.

Finally, I would like to thank my family for their constant support and motivate me during my studies.
