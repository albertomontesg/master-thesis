In the first place, I would like to thank Dr. Jordi Pont-Tuset for allowing me to do my master thesis with the segmentation group at Computer Vision Lab. In extension I would like to thank Kevis Maninis and Sergi Caelles for their advisory work. I am very gratefully to them all for their patiente and guidance during this Master Thesis. They also have teached me how to do research in the Computer Vision field.

From ETH Z\"urich, I would like to thank Prof. Luc Van Gool for giving me the opportunity to perform research in the Computer Vision Lab.

From UPC Barcelona, I would like to mention Prof. Xavi Gir\'o-i-Nieto, Prof. Ferran Marques, Amaia Salvador and Santiago Pascual. Was with them, in the Image Processing Group when I was performing my Bachelor Thesis, that I was introduced to Computer Vision and Image Processing. They support me to pursuing my studies in this field in ETH Z\"urich.

I would also like to thank my girlfriend Judith Bergad\`a for all his support given to me during the development of my studies and this thesis and pushing me forward.
